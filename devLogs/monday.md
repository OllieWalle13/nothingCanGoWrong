The first day of officially working on this project was an eventful one. I decided I'm going to make an autocross game where you need to finish your last runs to win the finals. 
To your despair, an evil hamster is in your car and is messing with all sorts of things causing your steering to inverse, your brakes to stop working, and more. Despite these setbacks, nothing can go wrong with your runs if you want to be the champ. 

As I'm a bit rusty, I'm leaning heaviliy on online tutorials as the backbone of the project (I'll be crediting them) as I'm a bit short on time after my other responsibilites. I currently have a handling model that seems alright and will serve as the basis of the driving mechanics. 

The real issues from today started when I tried to sync my local files with this repository. Firstly, I kept getting so many errors with the git terminal but most of them were resolved with the .gitignore. The next issue was sublime refusing to close a file which prevented me from
making any commits. This issue low-key resolved itself and I'm not sure what I did to fix it. After I finally got the commit pushed, I realized I made 2 nearly identical commits. I thought this looked bad so I thought "I'll just hard reset the branch head". This was a terrible idea 
and led to all of my work being erased from my local machine. Thankfully, I was able to checkout my last commit, move it to a new branch, check out the main branch, and then merge the two togethor. Afterwards, I pushed the merged main to GitHub and got everything back to normal.
