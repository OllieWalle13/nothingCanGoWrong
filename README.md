# Nothing can go wrong...
...is the the theme for [Brackey's Game Jam 2025.1!](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13) This will be my first time touching Unity since college and my first time using GitHub for version control and documentation purposes. As I'm a bit rusty, I'm not expecting to do anything crazy but I have a few goals in mind.

- [x] **Make a playable game**
- [x] **Have my submission ready in time**
- [ ] Create some sort of tutorial
- [ ] At least 5 levels
- [x] Perform some level of playtesting

I believe all of these goals are achievable but my priority will be the first two with everything else taking a backseat if needed.

## The Game Plan

This will be my first game jam and first time creating something with a such a short turnaround time. While I'm sure things will change, my rough timeline for the week will be as follows:

### Monday

- [x] Set up Unity environment and get it synced with GitHub
- [x] Come up with how I want to incorporate the theme into my game
- [x] Figure out the core gameplay loop
- [x] Brainstorm supplementary gameplay elements
- [ ] Organize all of my ideas based on what's needed, what would be nice, and what's not a priority

### Tuesday - Friday

- [x] Have a playable build by the end of day on Friday

### Saturday

- [x] Perform playtesting with a few friends Saturday morning
- [ ] Make adjustments where needed

### Sunday

- [ ] Last minute polish
- [x] Upload game to itch.io!

I'll be updating this file to check things off as I complete them as well as uploading logs to a seperate folder for each day of the jam to documents my success and failures along the way!
